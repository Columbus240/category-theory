(* Adjunctions relate two functors that map between the same two categories
  (though in opposite directions), in a manner that is weaker than isomorphism
  or equivalence, but still quite informative. In general, one functor is
  forgetful, and maps constructions from a more expressive domain into one
  that captures only the essence of that structure; while the other is free,
  and maps essential constructions into the fuller setting.

  As an example: the category of ASTs may be mapped forgetfully to the
  category of interpretated objects, which themselves map freely to some
  "canonical" representation of each such object. So, "3", "1 + 2", and "2 +
  1" all mean 3, while 3 is canonically represented by the constant "3". The
  forgetful functor is the evaluator, and the free functor a parser, giving
  rise to the following isomorphism (in the category of Sets, whose objects
  may be hom-sets):

      AST x ~{category of syntax or ASTs}~> y
        ≅ x ~{category of semantics or denotations}~> Denote y *)

(* Wikipedia: "If the functor F : C ← D has two right adjoints G and G', then
   G and G' are naturally isomorphic. The same is true for left adjoints." *)

(* Wikipedia: "The most important property of adjoints is their continuity:
   every functor that has a left adjoint (and therefore is a right adjoint) is
   continuous (i.e. commutes with limits in the category theoretical sense);
   every functor that has a right adjoint (and therefore is a left adjoint) is
   cocontinuous (i.e. commutes with colimits).

   Since many common constructions in mathematics are limits or colimits, this
   provides a wealth of information. For example:

   - applying a right adjoint functor to a product of objects yields the
   - product of the images; applying a left adjoint functor to a coproduct of
   - objects yields the coproduct of the images; every right adjoint functor
   - is left exact; every left adjoint functor is right exact." *)
